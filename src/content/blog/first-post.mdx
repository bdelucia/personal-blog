# What is Astro?

Astro is a JavaScript web framework (yes another one). But, this one is _langugage agnostic_, which means you can use a variety of UI frameworks, to name them: React, Vue, Preact, Svelte and Solid. Pretty "solid" lineup of frameworks there. But there are other language agnostic web frameworks out there, so what sets Astro apart? The big one: Astro ships zero-JS code if you just use pure Astro components + Markdown/MDX files.

I learned about Astro in the middle of adding to my Next.Js blog, which was enamored with a Supabase Auth system + 3 database tables, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline pushing to AWS ECS, an admin dashboard with Google Analytics data + full content-management system. But in all its glory, I wasn't using the blog a whole lot. And it was costing me a ton in AWS: $50.40 ($31.40 of which came from ECS) the first month, $52.33 ($42.38 of which came from ECS) the next month, $13.15 the third and $8.81 (the last month before I stopped the service).
